# Spotify-Clone-Ashutosh

This is a simple Spotify clone that highlights my favorite songs by Sushant KC. I built this project to practice front-end web development and to showcase a clean and minimal music streaming UI.

# Features:
1. Interactive UI with a sidebar, main content area, and music player.
2. Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
3. Styled using CSS with a dark theme similar to Spotify.
4. Smooth hover effects for an engaging user experience.

# Technologies Used:
1. HTML for structuring the webpage.
2. CSS for styling and animations.
3. FontAwesome for icons.
4. Google Fonts (Montserrat) for typography.

This project is inspired by Spotify’s design and my admiration for Sushant KC’s music. Hope you like it!
